			<h3> What types of problems is the language used for? </h3>

			<h3> What is the current state of the language?</h3>
				<p> As the time of writing this, PHP 8 is the current version of this programming language, and Though
				some websites that run services on this language shut down at 7.4, it is still a a ongoing language still in use
				by other web developers, and a language that had an extreme impact on the web
