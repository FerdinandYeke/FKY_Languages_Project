<h1>The ENIAC</h1>
<p>The ENIAC (also known as the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer</p>

<h3>What is the ENIAC</h3>
<p>The ENIAC (also known as the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) is a device that was made 
after WWII that computes vital values for weapon range tables. The ENIAC was a size of a room (perhaps the 
tallest computing device made at the time), whle also being a base 10 machine. The ENIAC was also programmed
by six women who were the "brains" of the ENIAC.</p>

<h3>What did the ENIAC Contain?</h3>
<p>The ENIAC Contained:
<ul>
	<li>17,468 vacuum tubes</li>
	<li>7,200 crystal diodes</li>
	<li>1,500 relays</li>
	<li>6,000 switches</li>
	<li>70,000 resistors</li>
	<li>10,000 capacitors</li>
	<li>About 5,000,000 hand-soldered joints</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other facts about the ENIAC</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The ENIAC can and does run continuously due to the extended tube life</li>
	<li>Due to the ENIAC running continuously, it generates 174 kilowatts of heat! This
	also needed its OWN AC system! (Similar to how servers generate so much heat to where they needed
	their own AC!)</li>
	<li>The ENIAC can also do caculations of addition from up to 5,000 a second</li>
	<li>The ENIAC was part of a group of computers at the time are know as the First Generation Computers.</li>
	<li>The first task the ENIAC done was doing calcuations for the hydrogen bomb in WWII</li>
</ul>
