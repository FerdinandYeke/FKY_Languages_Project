		<h3><b>When was C# created, and by who?</b></h3>
		<p>C sharp was first created in 2002. C sharp was created by Mr. Andres Hejlsberg. C sharp was made to be generally
		used, as well as being an object-oriented programming language from the start. C# throughout the years was also
		being developed by Microsoft.</p>
		
		<h3>The General History of the language</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>C# v1.0 (2002)</b>

					<p>In November of 2007, C# v3.0 was released, along with Visual Studio 2008 & .NET Framework v3.5. This
					is the version that really made C# a serious programming language. Features that it have are Auto-implemented properites,
					Anonymous types, Query expressions, Expression tress, Extension methods and so much more.</p>

					was much more "focused" on the language itself. A major feature this had were implementing concepts like
					" asynce" and "await" model for "asynchronous" programming. Other major features this version had are Asynchorous
					memebers, Caller info attributes, Code Project: Caller Info Attributes in C# 5.0.</p>

					functions, Expanded expression bodied members, Ref locals, & Ref returns. Other features that it had were
					Discards, Binary Literals and Digit Seperators, & Throw expressions.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>C# v7.1 (2017)</b>
					<p>In August of 2017, C# v7.1 was released. This version had new features implemented, which are
					asynce Main method, default literal expressions, Inferred tuple element names, & Patter matching on

				</li>
				
				<li><b>C# v7.2 (2017)</b>
					<p>In November of 2017, C# v7.2 was released. This version had small new features implemented, which are

				<li><b>C# v7.3 (2018)</b>
					<p>In May of 2018, C# v7.3 was released. This version had more new features implemented, which they help

					Nullable reference types, and more.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>C# v9 (2020)</b>

			<h3> What types of problems is the language used for? </h3>
				<p>As you seen and learned above, the C# language was a general language that can make programs,
				software, and web applications professionaly and efficently.</p>
				
			<h3> What is the current state of the language?</h3>
				<p> As the time of writing this, C# v12 is the current version of the programming language. It is still used to make
				programs/software and web applications. It is still an ongoing language that evolved with the times, and will continue
				to grow and evolve with other programming languages today and into the future.</p>
