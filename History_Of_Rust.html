		<h3><b>When was Rust created, and by who?</b></h3>
		<p>Rust was first made at around 2009. Rust was created by computer programmer Graydon Hoare, who also work on a well known company Mozilla. 
		He started designing the language due to an elevator problem that occurred in his apartment, 
		where the problem was due to memory issues with The elevator. So, he wanted to make 
		a language that works without any memory bugs. </p>
		
		<h3>The General History of the language</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Rust (2009)</b> 
					<p>In 2009, Mozilla took an interest in Rust, and decided to offically sponser it.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Rust (Early 2010s)</b>
					<p>In 2010 and onward, Mozilla engineers & Rust volunters worked together to further
					develop Rust's way managing memory. They created the "ownership" system Rust is well known for.
					This system's function was designed in a way to reduce memory problems by having a piece of data
					being "referred" to a single variable, and no more.</p>
					
					<p>In 2013, Rust had removed their garbage collecter feature. This help programs that were programmed
					with the Rust programming language to run more effienctly.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Rust (Late 2010s)</b>
					<p>In 2015, the Rust team & Mozilla offically released the FIRST STABLE version of Rust.</p>
					
					<p>In 2016, Rust's was being implemented into a new browser Servo, which was made by a group in
					Mozilla. This was released in 2016.</p>
					
					<p>In 2017, Rust was also used to rewrite a portion of Firefox's function that display Cascading style
					sheets. This helped Firefox run faster and more efficently.</p>
				</li>

			<h3> What types of problems is the language used for? </h3>
				<p>As you seen and learned above, the Rust language was a way to professionally 
				build websites and software efficiently. But the unique thing about it is that it is a newer programming
				language that helps proctect against memory issues, which would pose a huge security problem if issues don't get treated.
				This is thanks to Rusts way of managing memory and it's garbage collection feature being no longer in use.</p>
				
			<h3> What is the current state of the language?</h3>
				<p> As the time of writing this, Rust 1.76.0 is the current version of this programming language, which released
				on February of 2024, where it is still used to make websites and programs! Also, more software companies like Dropbox, Discord,
				and even Amazon Web Services used Rust to improve their software services as well! In 2021, the Rust Foundation was founded to
				support volunteer programmers where it grants $20,000 for them that want to work on more feature s on Rust. Rust is NEW programming
				language that will continue to evolve, and bring a better future for software, web development, and is having an impact on the world
				of programming and software security based on the history.</p>
