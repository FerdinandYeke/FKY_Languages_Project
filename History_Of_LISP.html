		<h3><b>When was LISP created, and by who?</b></h3>
		<p>LISP was created by John McCarthy at around 1958. It is one of the oldest programming language to be made.</p>
		
		<h3>The General History of the language</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Pre-LISP (1956-1958)</b> 
					<p>John first brainstormed creating a language during the 1956 Darthmouth Summer Research
					Project on Artifical Intelligence. When he noticed Information Processing Language that 
					was made by Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, he thought that having algebraic expressions would
					serve use, but then thought that symbolic list were an effective way to forming problems in A.I., like
					with problems that involve deduction. In 1957 when he worked on a chess program in Fortran, it made
					him notice some problems in the design, so he introduced new alternatives, like a "true" conditional
					expression and making the new maplist function.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Start of LISP (1958)</b>
					<p><p>In the Fall of 1958, John, now assisant professer at MIT, sent students to work on LISP.
					LISP's syntax undergone changes like having S-expressions, which though is a low level representation
					for the machine, can still be used by the team to represent lists of data and functions.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>LISP: "Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine (1960)</b>
					<p>In 1960, McCarthy released a paper of LISP that is named, " Recursive Functions of Symbolic
					Expressions and Their Computation by Machine. At this point, Lisp was not just a programming language,
					but a well made "mathematical system".</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>LISP (mid-1970s to 1980s)</b>
					<p>In the mid-1970s, A.I. researchers were running out of power, like the PDP-10. Peter Deutsch
					thought of a solution to make a computer that is made to run Lisp programs. In the 1980s, companies 
					like Symbolics were able to utilize Lisp. Symbolics produced the 3600 series which had large screens,
					bit-mapped graphics, a mouse interface, & a powerful graphics and animation software. Bob Cully who worked
					in robotics research was able to visually implement a path finding algorithm on the Symbolics 3650 in 1985.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (1985)</b>
					<p>In 1985, MIT professors Harold Abelson, Gerald Sussman and his wife Julie Sussman, published the textbook
					"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs." This textbook introduced readers to programming by using the 
					language "Scheme", which is a dialect of Lisp. This was also used to teach MIT's introductory programming class for
					decades.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Lisp influence after its prime (1980s)</b>
					<p>Even though Lisp became unpopular and market for lisp machines crashed once C++ was released the same 
					year as SICP, Lips still had influence in other very used and popular programming languages today like C# with Linq,
					Python with List comprehensions, and Ruby being a Lisp type programming language!</p>
				</li>

			<h3> What types of problems is the language used for? </h3>
				<p>As you seen and learned above, the lisp language was a general language that is used to learn 
				general programming, as well as being a language for mathematical uses like recursive functions, and
				being one of the first to visualize a path finding animation with a path finding algorithm.</p>
				
			<h3> What is the current state of the language?</h3>
				<p> As the time of writing this, even though the language is "dead", it continues to live on in other programming languages like
				C++, Ruby, Python, and more. It had a very important impact in the Computer Science sphere on early A.I. research, as well has having
				a book that captures and explains the core and philosophy of computer science and programming, which many say still plays a very big 
				role in the computer science sphere to this day!</p>
